# Concordia-Kind-WSSR-Workshops
Workshop files
This is a repository for various files connected to ongoing workshops that I give for the Kind Institute from Concordia Unvirsity in Montreal, eh. It gets replenished usually in December prior to activities at the SPSA meeting in January.
Puerto Rico es asombroso.
Kerry and Mebs are great too.
